This is huffpuff, a tool that encodes strings using Huffman compression.

huffpuff is specialized for NES development, thus the only supported
output format is 6502 assembly.

huffpuff is intended to be used to compress (large amounts of) in-game
text, e.g. for cut scenes or NPC interaction.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

See doc/index.html for documentation, or do "man huffpuff" after
installation.
